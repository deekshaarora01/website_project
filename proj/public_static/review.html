       <div class="Testimonial">

            <h4 id="head6">I really can't say enough...</h4>

            <p>When my son began to struggle with literacy at school,

                <br> I decided to look for a private tutor to help him get back on track. Having spent some time researching various private tutors, I was recommended Jan Long. Following his free assessment, Jan was able to plan the best course of action for my son, in order to regain his confidence

                 and help him achieve a level of literacy she knew he was capable of. </p>

  

   <p>I now have a very happy, confident child, who enjoys writing,

       reading and learning, and who no longer shies away from a workbook

       

        and pencil! I cannot recommend Jan and her team enough if you are looking 

        for extra tuition for your child.

            <p>Thank you for the fantastic work you've done with Melany. We all feel she's 

                benefited a lot from the time

                 you've spent together, both technically and gaining in confidence.

            <h4 id="head8">Confidence grew</h4>

            <p>Zain grew in confidence in his maths when he joined Southampton Tuition Centre. 

                His mental maths used to amaze his maths teacher. He misses not coming 

                in and now that he

                will be starting GCSEs soon I plan to bring him back to restart his tuition with Jan.
